# nanostar_scat
Some python code for calculating scattering from nanostars using DDSCAT.
The code in this repository is developed from the excellent work of William Morton. See https://github.com/shakespearemorton/starscat for the original code. The main changes are to allow dipole seperation of less than 1 nm, and to introduce a dielectric core to the sphere.
